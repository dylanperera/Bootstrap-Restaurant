# Bootstrap Restaurant

Built a mock restaurant website using Bootstrap, features include navbars, modals, forms, and the grid system.

[Live Demo](https://dylanperera.github.io/Bootstrap-Restaurant) :point_left:

### Features
- Navbars
- Form to reserve a table and send feedback
- Tables to display data
- Cards
- Alerts for different foods (if it's hot, new, etc.,)
- Tabbed Navigation to show the user where they are relative to main page
- Accordion to display facts about employees

### Future Implementations:
1. Implement a menu page to show different foods on the pages
2. Implement a backend, so that the user can save the data they enter (like reserving a table) and send notifications to the users phone or email to notify them whether the reservation has been confirmed.
